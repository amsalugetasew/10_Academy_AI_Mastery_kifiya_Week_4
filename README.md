Rossmann Pharmaceuticals data to forecast sales in all their stores across several cities six weeks ahead of time. Base on promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality as necessary for predicting the sales across the various stores.

for this porject users need to install 
pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, sklear

steps 1: loading rossmann-store-sales data 
incliding its store, and sales data with train and test splited on scr/data folder
steps 2: perform EDA
steps 3: Promotion Analysis for checking wheather the promotion has effect or not
steps 4: Time Series Analysis which used to identify its seasonality effect over sales like holiday, opening week day, non-holiday effect
steps 5: visulizig every analysis by chart


There is developed Saved models under Model folder using algorithms Randome Forest and LSTM for time series sales data for predicting next sales data
user can load the trained .pkl model files for prediction bu just using my Django code I created with a name of sales_prediction
